### Distribution visualizer

Plotly dash app that allows user to input parameters for and visualize
a beta distribution or a multivariate normal distribution (with 2 variables).

For the beta distribution, the app also outputs the mean, median and standard
deviation of the distribution.

#### Running
Currently, the app is set up to run locally, so make sure that you have the
Python libraries specified at the top of the distr_display.py installed, and
then run this file.

From the command-line, after navigating to the directory of the app,
this would look like this:

```python distr_display.py```
